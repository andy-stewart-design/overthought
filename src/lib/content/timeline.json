While we often talk about them as existing at the lowest level of our systems, they are in fact made up of an even more ganular set of tokens for attributes like font family, weight, size, etc. Each of the individual styles in this system, for example, are built from one of 3 families, 4 weights, 14 sizes, 5 amounts of leading, and 3 amounts of tracking.",

			"body": "Semantic v. Primitive. If you've read through Figma's Variables playground file, you saw these two terms a lot. But in my opinion, they were never clearly defined. Here's my take: the difference between primitive and semantic design tokens is as simple as the difference between What and How. Primitive tokens define a literal attribute (what something is) where semantic tokens describe an intended function (how something should be used).",

Whether it's basic addition, subtraction, and division, probabilities, or the undulations of waveforms, Math is the engine that drives everything in these compositions, from motion to color distribution.",

			"body": "I've been playing around with and building interfaces on top of LLMs for the past several weeks. This is a basic proof of concept leveraging Spotify and Open AI's APIs to offer music recommendations based on a user-provided artist. Surprisingly, its recommendations are generally pretty good and it only infrequently makes up artists who don't exist—which I can usually catch by cross-checking results with Spotify. Now that I've got the basic functionality worked out, I want to further push and develop the UX/UI into something more interesting and delightful.",

Since then we've continued to expand the set as needed, month-by-month, icon-by-icon. One of my parting gifts to the Turnstyle team was an internal web app for browsing and downloading icons from the set to hopefully make managing the project easier moving forward.",

It took a bit of wrangling to make sure that we were always cropping either the top and bottom or left and right, depending on the screen size.",
